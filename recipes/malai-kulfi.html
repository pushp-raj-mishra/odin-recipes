    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Malai Kulfi</strong> is a traditional Indian frozen dessert known for its rich, creamy texture and intense flavor. Unlike regular ice cream, kulfi is denser and melts more slowly. It is often flavored with cardamom, saffron, or pistachios and served on a stick or in a matka (earthen pot).</p>
